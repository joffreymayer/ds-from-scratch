There, you will install all the libraries you need. The major advantage here, is that you can control the version you install the library. Furthermore, you can send the venv to another computer and the people will download exactly the versions of each library. This allows that your code will always work, independently of the machine you will use! There will be no dependency problems anymore, which is a huge win.. :) 1.1.1 Create a venv Go to your terminal and plug in the following code: conda create -n YOUR-VENVIRONMENT-NAME-HERE python=3.6 1.1.2 Activate your newly created venv Weirdly though, you also need to activate the environment you created above. Plug in the following code: source activate YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME Note that the code above can also be used to activate virtual environments you created in the past! =) "],["python-libraries.html", "Chapter 2 Python Libraries 2.1 Time-Series Forecasting", " Chapter 2 Python Libraries 2.1 Time-Series Forecasting Here, I will explore different libraries that will allow you to make forecasts into the future. 2.1.1 Facebook Prophet Aus einer didaktischen Perspektive ist die offizielle Dokumentation der Prophet-Library wunderbar, um die Unterschiede zwischen R &amp; Python (Objekt-Orientierte Programmierung) zu entdecken.
