There, you will install all the libraries you need. The major advantage here, is that you can control the version you install the library. Furthermore, you can send the venv to another computer and the people will download exactly the versions of each library. This allows that your code will always work, independently of the machine you will use! There will be no dependency problems anymore, which is a huge win.. :) 3+2 ## [1] 5 For you to able to construct a book into an HTML-File, you will need the following 2 commands. The first is absolutely necessary, the second one is simply to check whether you rendered everything correctly by viewing the browser: bookdown::render_book(\"index.Rmd\") to render the .md-file into an .html-file. browseURL(\"docs/index.html\") to see what happens. In this bookdown-chapter, I will simply try to type some code, to see whether the code I have written truly works. 2+2 ## [1] 4 "],["python-libraries.html", "Chapter 2 Python Libraries 2.1 Time-Series Forecasting", " Chapter 2 Python Libraries 2.1 Time-Series Forecasting Here, I will explore different libraries that will allow you to make forecasts into the future. 2.1.1 Facebook Prophet Aus einer didaktischen Perspektive ist die offizielle Dokumentation der Prophet-Library wunderbar, um die Unterschiede zwischen R &amp; Python (Objekt-Orientierte Programmierung) zu entdecken.
