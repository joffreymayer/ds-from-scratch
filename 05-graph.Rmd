# Visualization

When you analyze data, it is crucial to communicate with simplicity what evidence you found. Therefore, this chapter will focus on how to bring your evidence to your audience.

## Graphs with Python

When you work with Python, there are three main libraries you need to know: 

- `seaborn`, which can plot extremely beautiful graphs, without much efforts. 
- `matplotlib`, for more advanced stuff, this is the library you need to master.
- `plotly`, for implementations into websites. Noob.

### Seaborn

#### Draw a Time-Series (= Line-Chart)

- A line-chart is often used to visualize a trend in the data over time.

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.lineplot(data = spotify_data)
```

#### Draw a Barplot (= Barchart)

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.barplot(x = data.Racing, y = data.index)
```

#### Draw a Heatmap

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.heatmap(data = flight_data, annot = True)
```

#### Draw a Scatterplot (Streudiagramm // Punktwolke)

- You can check, whether you have enough variation in your data to predict the dependent variable. 

##### With 2 variables (incl. regression-line)

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.scatterplot(x = health_data['bmi'], y = health_data['life_expectancy'])

# include a regression-line:
sns.regplot(x = health_data['bmi'], y = health_data['life_expectancy'])
```

##### With 3 variables, where 2 are `continuous` & 1 is `categorical`

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.scatterplot(x = health_data['bmi'], y = health_data['life_expectancy'], hue = health_data['smoker'])

# include a regression-line:
sns.lmplot(x = health_data['bmi'], y = health_data['life_expectancy'], hue = health_data['smoker']) # note that it is not the same, as when you used 2 variables!
```

#### Draw a Histogram

A histogram sorts the data, then it is putting the data into intervalls of data (= batches) and finally counts the frequency those batches occur.

- Useful to check the distribution of the data

> Why should we use this?

For example, in order to see whether our data is normally distributed (= Glockenkurve). 

_By definition - if a variable follows (roughly) a normal distribution - you can standardize the variable._

<mark>If you want to do _Deep Learning_, then a transformation like normalisation (OR standardisation?) is required, that's the reason why we care about the distribution!</mark>

##### Discrete Version

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

sns.distplot(
a = iris_data['Petal Length (cm)'], # a column you would like to plot
label = "Rose",
kde = False # "Kernel Density Estimate" (kde): always provide this input when creating a histogram
)
```

##### Continuous Version (Kernel Density Estimate)

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

### ---- Standard KDE-Plot
sns.kdeplot(
data = iris_data['Petal Length (cm)'],
shade = True # colors the area below the curve
)

### ---- 2-Dimensional KDE-Plot, when using more than 1 column
sns.jointplot(
x = iris_data['Petal Length (cm)',
y = iris_data['Septal Width (cm)'],
kind = "kde"
)
```

#### Change Style of different `Seaborn`-Plots

- <u>Key</u>:Set the new style BEFORE you run your code for the actual graph!

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import seabron as sns

### ---- Example for changing the colors // styles with a new style "dark":
sns.set_style("dark") # Possibile styles to choose from: {"darkgrid", "whitegrid", "dark", "white", "ticks"}
```

### Matplotlib

#### Set Width & Height of Graph

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6)) # 1. width, 2. height
```

#### Set title of Graph

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.title('Hello World')
```

#### Set Label of Axes

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.ylabel('Average Gaming Score')
plt.xlabel('Date')
```

#### Force Legend to appear

```{python, eval=FALSE}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.legend()
```
