# Computer Set-Up

When building projects *efficiently*, you will need different set-ups in order to have everything in your code work properly, *not only on your own machine, but also on other machines, for example of another team-member*.

## Virtual Environment 

Because the libraries you work with in your projects will be updated over time (this is generally *bad news*, since this will cause all sorts of dependency problems across your libaries you use), it is crucial to understand that you will need a virtual environment (`venv`). There, you will install all the libraries you need. The **major advantage here, is that you can control the version you install the library**. Furthermore, you can send the `venv` to another computer and the people will download exactly the versions of each library. 

<mark>This allows that **your code will <u>always</u> work, independently of the machine you will use**! There will be no dependency problems anymore, which is a huge win.</mark>. :)

### Create a `venv`

Go to your terminal and plug in the following code:

```
conda create -n YOUR-VENVIRONMENT-NAME-HERE python=3.6
```

### Activate your newly created `venv`

Weirdly though, you also need to activate the environment you created above. Plug in the following code:

```
source activate YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME
```

<mark>**Note that the code above can also be used to activate virtual environments you created in the past**!</mark> =) 

### Install packages

Now that you are in your new `venv`, you can start downloading some packages:

```
python -m pip install SOME-PACKAGES
```

### Overview of packages

To check your packages within your `venv`, simply type:

```
conda list
```

### Overview of every `venv` 

To check all the `venv` I created, simply type:

```
conda env list
```

### Execute any python skript

In order to execute a `Python`-script, you will need to head towards the directory that the `.py`-file is and - then - type in:

```
cd go-to-the-dir-where-your-file-is
python my-script.py
```

### Deactivate the `venv`

After you have completed what you wanted, you will need to shut-down the `venv`. Simply type:

```
conda deactivate
```

### Delete a `venv`

Simply type:

```
conda env remove -n my-new-env
```

## R Markdown

When writing Code, I recommend you to use `.Rmd`-Documents, which will allow you to combine both, text, as well as Code (in R, Python, or any other language of your choice).

Actually, this document is written in `.Rmd`-Files, where I combine the text, with so-called "code-snippets", like the follwing:

```
This is a Code-Snippet
```

When writing Code in `R-Markdown`, it will be useful for you to know when: 

1) to execute code wihtin a code-snippet
2) and where not.

### Hide Source Code

This will be done with `echo = FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

With figures, you need `fig.show = 'hide'` in R:

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
plot(cars)
```

To hide warning-messages, just use `message = FALSE`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
message("You will not see the message.")
```

### Execute a Code-Chunk without showing any Output

You will get an output, e.g. the code will execute, but you will not show the code.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# any R code here
```

### Do NOT execute a Code-Chunk

If you want to show code for demonstration purposes - like on this Website - 
you will probably want to only show the code, but not execute it. This is also possible with `eval=FALSE`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
# any R code here
```

### RMarkdown- VS. Markdown-Files

- Verwende `<ins></ins>` als HTML, um Texte zu Unterstreichen. 
  - <ins>Achtung</ins>: Der HTML-Tag `<u></u>` geht nicht in `.rm`-files. Lustigerweise funktioniert `<u></u>` jedoch in `.Rmd` (= R Markdown) 😂
  
### Nützliche Hexadecimals

- Hexadecimal code for the left square-bracket = `&#91;` --> Ich muss das so machen mit den eckigen Klammern, weil `[]` wird für Links & Bilder verwendet in `Markdown` 🤪
- Hexadecimal code for the right square-bracket = `&#93;` --> Ich muss das so machen mit den eckigen Klammern, weil `[]` wird für Links & Bilder verwendet in `Markdown` 🤪

## Terminal-Commands:

A terminal will be essential for your projects, since you will - oftentimes - install packages or move files around your repositories with it. Here, you will find the most useful things you should know when using the `Terminal`.

### Aktuelle Position // Directory?

- <u>For Mac</u>: `pwd` = print working directory

- <u>For Windows</u>: `dir` = this is the same command as `pwd`, but `dir` is for `Windows`

### Showing the child-directories inside the directory you are currently in?

- `ls` = prints all the `child-directories` (= one layer deeper of the path) from the `parent-directory` (= current directory you are in with your terminal) you are currently in.

### Delete everything you wrote in your `Terminal` up until now?

- `clear` = clears the terminal

### Change directory?

- `cd` = change directory
  - `cd ..` = go back one directory.
  
### Creating a new directory?

`mkdir new-folder-1 new-folder-2 new-folder-3` = This creates 3 new folder within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Create a new file?

`touch index.html app.css` == This will create an `index.html`, as well as a `app.css`-file within the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Remove files?

`rm index.html app.css capture.png` = This will delete the `index.html`-, the `app.css` and the `capture.png`-files from the current (working-) directory you are currently in.

### Open the current directory you are in?

- `open .` = opens the current directory you are in

### Terminal Magic-Commands for being faster?

- <u>Trick #1</u>: hit the "Tab-Taste" == will automatically auto-fill the name of the file / directories etc.
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd Dok` + "Tab"-Taste --> *auto-fill activates* --> im Terminal steht dann der automatisch ausgefüllte Name des Files / Directories, zum Beispiel `cd Dokumente` bzw. `cd Name_Of_Child_Directory` 
- <u>Trick #2</u>: How to find a path of a directory that is situated very deeply in your local computer?
  - <u>Example</u>: Type `cd ` + drag-&-drop the **folder** that is deep in your computer with the file in it.
  
### Syntax im Terminal

- `*`-Zeichen == Represents "all files".

#### <u>Beispiel</u>: Delete all Files in a folder that start with the letter `a`?

To delete all files in a folder that start with the letter `a`, then you should write:

```
/folder/a*
```

- `.`-Zeichen == use the `.` character to represent the **current folder**.
- `~`-Zeichen == represents the "home directory".

#### <u>Beispiel</u>: how to return to your home directory?

You should use:

```
cd ~
```

## How to activate &amp; use Python?

`Python` can be executed on your local computer via a `Jupyter Notebook`, which can be accessed through an IDE. `R`, `Visual Studio Code` or `PyCharm` are examples of IDEs. 

Let's assume, that we took `PyCharm` as our IDE. We do the following steps:

1) Use the `Terminal` <u>within</u> PyCharm.
2) Once you opened the PyCharm-`Terminal`, go to the directory that will be used for the Jupyter Notebook, by typing something as `cd /some_folder_name`.
3) Finally, type in `jupyter notebook` in the `Terminal` to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.

## Git &amp; Github: 
	
- `pull request` = "Take some changes from a particular branch and bring it into another branch."
	- <u>Achtung</u>: es ist eine *Request*, es wurde noch nichts gemerged! Für das brauch es noch `merge` als zusätzlichen Befehl. 		
- `fork a repo` = "Take someone else's repo - because you love it 😊  - and put it into your own list of repos, in order to be able to edit it yourself without affectig the original repository of the owner."
- `commit` = save
- `hash` = unique identifier in the history of files. A `has` is a huge string composed of characters (= Buchstaben) & numbers and is used when using a version-control software, such as `Git`.
				
> How to tell the original owner you want to merge <u>your</u> changes that you made back into their orignal repo and implement them those changes into their original work // repo?
				
Look at [the youtube video from Coding Train ab 9:35-11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=3)
  
  - To see how to **refer** to issues & bugs in your code <u>directly</u> via your commit-command, [look at the youtube video ab 6:35-7:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=4) and to <u>diretly</u> **close** issues, because you resolved it, look [look at the youtube video ab 7:40-8:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=4).

> What is a remote?

A remote is a **duplicate instance of your repository (on your local computer)** that lives somewhere else on a remote server (like Github).
				
### First time using Git &amp; Github

There are specific `Git`-commands that you need to know, when you begin to start to work with `Git` and Gibthun for the first time. Note that all these `Git`-commands need to be typed <u>within the Terminal</u> on your local computer.
	
- `git config --list` = Sehr wichtig, **wenn du `Git` zum ersten Mal via einem neuen Computer runst**! Dieser Befehl zeigt dir, welchen Username & Email du aktuell  verwendest (schaue bei `user.name` & `user.email`, ob es deine Github Anmelde-Daten sind). Es ist key - **insbesondere, wenn du neu mit Git beginnst** - dass diese  Parameter mit deinen Github Anmelde-Daten übereinstimmen! Ansonsten musst du immer `git clone` machen und die ältere Version in einen "alt"-Ordner tun, was extrem mühsam ist. 
  - Wenn du noch keinen `user.name` hast, dann gebe folgenden Code in die Command-Line ein: `git config --global user.name 'Dein_Github_UserName'`.
	  - <u>Beachte</u>: Schreibe den Namen <u>**mit**</u> die Anführungszeichen!
  - Wenn du noch keinen `user.name` hast, dann gebe folgenden Code in die Command-Line ein: `git config --global user.name 'deineEmail@email.ch'`.
	  - <u>Beachte</u>: Schreibe die Email <u>**ohne**</u> die Anführungszeichen!
  - <u>Check if it worked</u>?: Gebe wieder den Befehl `git config --list` und schaue bei `user.name` & `user.email`, ob dort deine Github Anmelde-Daten übernommen wurden.
	
- `git push` = this is the act of sending to `Github`.
- `git pull` = this is the act of receiving from `Github`.

### 2 Key concepts in Git

Before starting to work with `Git`, you need to understand that there are 2 ways of starting a project:

```
1) Create a `remote` repository on Github and then `cloning` it - via Git - on your local computer to work from there.
2) Creating a repository `locally` on your computer and then - aftre a few months working on this repository - adding it to Github.
```

*Depending on which of those 2 different ways you choose to start a project (create a repo right from the get-go on `Github` VS. work locally and then - after some time - push everything to `Github`), the Git-Commands will slightly differ.*

#### Start Project via Github (remote-possibility)
		
> What are the Git-Commands, if you start your project directly by creating a Repo on Github (= *possibility 1*) above)? 
		
- `git clone https://github.com/joffreymayer/tageb.git` == Will clone your <u>remote</u> directory `tageb` - which is currently on Github on your <u>local</u> computer, which is simpler // more comfy when working on projects =)
- `git status` = Assume that you worked on & modified a file on your local computer that you previously had on Github (you cloned the directory with the file in it on your local computer). With the command `git status`, `Git` will check whether there is any changes between your local files VS. the files in the remote directory on the Github-Server // -Website.
- <a name="anchor-1">`git commit -a -m "Test comment for a commit"`</a> = If you changed a file locally and you are happy with your results, you will need to make a `commit` (= save) <u>and</u> `add` all files (= this is why we have an input // argument `-a`; the concept of `adding` will be explored in the chapter below, where you want to put a local repo into Github after a few months) and you also want to document, what exactly you modified, if you need to go back to a previous version of your file (= this is why we have an input // argument `-m "comment is here..."`).
- `git push origin master` = If you have done some changes locally on your file, you can now `push` everything on the Github-Website.
- `git log` = see, locally, the history of your `git commit`s.
	- <u>Achtung</u>: When running this command, you might - accidentally - run into a dangerous environment called `VIM`, which is a terminal-based text-editor. The problem when you are in `VIM`, is that you might not be able to get out of it. 
		-<u>Solution</u>: To get out of `VIM`, just type in `:q` and you will get out of it.
- `git remote -v` = This will tell you which URL is the `remote` on which your repository is hosted.
	- <u>Merke</u>: The URL of your repo is *assigned* to the variable `origin` in `Git`.
	
#### Start Project via local computer (local-possibility)
		
> What commands do you need, when you decide - after a few months working <u>locally</u> on your computer - to put everything on Github (= *possibility 2*)?
		
- `git init` == To get started, you need to go to your repository with your terminal - e.g. set the working directory with `cd Joffrey\dokumente\my_project`) first - and, then, transform your repository to a *Git-Repository* by just typing `git init` into your terminal.
- `git add single_file.txt` == *After* you initialized your repository, you will have an **empty git-repository**. `Git` will <u>not</u> `track` the files in your repository (= `untracked files`), unless you explicitly point them out via the `git add` command.
	- <u>If you want to add all files quickly // simultanoeusly</u>: `git add .`
	- <u>Für genauere Theorie // Erklärung dahinter</u>: Siehe Youtube-Video Coding Train ab [2:10-6:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p2d-CuVlgc&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=7)
- `git commit -m "Adding a new comment for my commit"`: *After* having pointed out to `Git`, which files he needs to track, you can do a `commit` of the changes of the files you modified, like in *possibility 1)*. 
	- <u>Achtung, es gibt einen kleinen Unterschied zu *possibility 1)*</u>: das `-a` ([siehe oben](#anchor-1)) ist verschwunden, weil wir hier `add` und `commit` als zwei separate Schritte betrachten.
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/joffreymayer/new-repo` = Because our repository is still currently not on `Github`, we <u>first</u> need to [go on the Github Website](https://github.com/joffreymayer?tab=repositories) and create an <u>empty</u> repository. *After* having done this, you need to tell `Git` - with the command `git remote add origin` + **copy-pasting the URL** "https://github.com/joffreymayer/new-repo" - that this is our local 
	- <u>Check if it worked</u>: Type the following into the Terminal `git remote -v`. It should output the variable name - usually called `origin` - 
		- <u>Note if you want to be fancy</u>: Within `git remote add origin`, the name `origin` can be changed to any word you like. This is just the variable name in which your Github-URL will be stored.
	- If there is already a remote with the default name `origin` but you don't like the name, you can change the name by: 
		1) `git remote remove origin` --> this will delete the remote
		2) `git remote -v` --> just to check if step 1) worked --> should not output anything
		3) `git remote add noob https:\\github.com\project-1` --> now, re-name the remote and call it `noob` 
- `git push origin master` == *Finally*, you will be able to put all your files into the freshly made remote-repository on `Github`.
- `git pull origin master` == Assume that you did changes `remotly` on Github but not yet locally on your computer. This does not matter, since you can just enter the command `git pull origin master` to be able to retrieve the changes that you did `remotly` on Github onto your local computer =)

### Working with Branches
		
> Tutorial for branches?

Look at [youtube-videos from Coding Train](https://youtu.be/oPpnCh7InLY).
		
- `git branch new_branch` == this will create a branch locally on your computer
- `git checkout new_branch` == this will tell `Git`: "ah, he wants to go into the branch called 'new_branch'".
- `git branch` == this will give you a list of all the branches you ave created locally. Furthermore, it will tell you on which branch you currently work on.

> How to merge the changes you made on a separate branch to the `master-branch` (= main branch)?
		
1) `git branch new_branch` == this will **create a branch** called `new_branch` locally on your computer.
2) `git checkout new_branch` == You will tell `Git`: "I now want to **work on this newly created branch** called 'new_branch'".
3) `git checkout master` == *After* you are happy with the changes you did in `new_branch` you will need to prepare for the merging by **switching to your main-branch**, which is the `master`-branch.
4) `git merge new_branch` == Since you currently are in the `master-branch`, Git will know that you want to **merge** `new_branch` <u>into</u> the `master-branch`.
		
That was it 😎

## LaTeX

This `bookdown` is created via a `.Rmd`-File. For a `Markdown` to be able to read some mathematical formulas, we will need the `LaTeX`-language.

### Data Science VS. mein Economics-Studium

> Was ist der Unterschied zwischen einem `Data Scientist` VS. was ich in meinem `Economics-Studium` gemacht habe?

- <u>Erkenntnis</u>: Machine Learning wird als eine "Black Box" betrachtet, wo man den X-Variablen des Modells keine grosse Beachtung schenkt: man bringt sie einfach ins Modell rein. Im Kontrast dazu, sind Ökonomen mehr dazu getrimmt, mit Hilfe eines theoretischen Modells, die "richtigen" X-Variablen zu selektieren.

### IDE explained

> What is an **IDE**?

- <u>Abkürzung</u>: `IDE` == Integrated Development Environment
- <u>Definition</u>: An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications. It combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
  - <u>Example</u>: R, PyCharm oder Visual-Studio Code are all IDEs. Think of it as a modern Dream Weaver! :)
  
> Was ist `IDE PyCharm`?

Das ist das RStudio von Python.
  
### Restful API
  
> What are **Rest APIs**? 

- <u>Synonym</u>: Restful APIs
- <u>Defintion</u>: API stands for *<u>A</u>pplication <u>P</u>rogramming <u>I</u>nterface*. An API is a contract that allows a developer (= you) to interact with an "application" (= a database // the object of interest) through a set of "interfaces" (= list of URLs // this is *how* you are able to interact with the "application", which can be an App, a library in R / Python or a Database).
	- Quelle: [Pokemon-API](https://pokeapi.co/about)
- <u>Zusammengefasst in meinen Worten</u>: **Ein API sind Befehle, die du gibst, um mit einer Datenbank (z.B. auf einem Server) zu kommunizieren oder ein Package (in R oder Python) zum runnen zu bringen.** Ganz einfach xD
- <u>Background Client-Server Architecture</u>: most of the applications these days, follow this architecture.
  - Client == App itself == Front-End
  - Server == Back-End
  
- Communication between the Sever & the Client (= App) happens via API by using the `Http Protocol`.
  - <u>Example</u>: if the App wants to access the particular data of a customer, it sends a request to the server via http-protocol.
- **So, when does the `Rest API` comes into play?** --> the Rest API is **a standard that established itself in the industry, when communaction between client & server** --> these are the `CRUD Operations`, which are by definition: 
  
    1) `GET` == *getting the data from the server*
    2) `POST` == *creating data*
    3) `PUT` == *updating data*
    4) `DELETE` == *deleting data*
    
#### API Example

> Beispiel eines `API` in Python?

Das Modul // Package `sktime` verwendet einen ähnlichen `API`, wie die berühmte Machine-Learning `sklearn`-Library. Hierbei wäre der Programmierer (= Du) als *Forecaster* verstanden, welcher via sogannten *methods* (zum Beispiel die *fit-method*, um das Modell zu trainieren // estimaten) mit der *application* (= hier: Python) interagiert.

### Magic Commands in Python 

> "Magic Commands" in Python, mit denen du unglaublich schnell herausfinden kannst, was eine Funktion überhaupt tut UND welche Inputs in eine Funktion gehören?

1) `shift` + `Tab` &#8594; wenn du nicht weisst, was eine Funktion // Method tut
2) `Tab` &#8594; innerhalb einer Funktion, um eine Übersicht zu allen Inputs zu erhalten! xD

### Pipe-Operator in R

> What is the `Pipe-Operator` in `R` and what does it do?

The Pipe-Operator in `R` looks like this: `%>%`. It takes in an input and "transports" it into another function to use the input and produces an output. This verbal explanation can be best illustrated via a code-example in R: 

```
library(tidyverse)
result <- mtcars %>% 
    group_by(cyl) %>% 
    summarise(meanMPG = mean(mpg))
```

- Quelle: [A Guide to the Pipe in R](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-the-pipe-in-r-823090760d64#:~:text=The%20pipe%20operator%20feeds%20the,the%20tibble%20result%20%2C%20shown%20below.)

### Docker

> Was ist `Docker` und was ist der Vorteil davon?

Docker ist ein **Virtual Environment**, welches - wie ein Container - dir Punktgenaue Versionen von bestimmten Packages und Programmiersprachen (Python etc.) liefert. `Docker` läuft über `Open Shift`, welches eine Art **Management-Programm** für `Docker` ist (so viel ich das verstanden habe...).

Wichtig zu wissen ist, dass JEDES `Data Science Kit Notebook` ein Docker-Container ist, welcher auf `Open Shift` läuft. Dies hat den Vorteil, dass jedes dieser Notebooks auf jeder Maschine ge-runnt werden kann, ohne das Error-Problemen wegen aktualisierten Libraries zu begengnen.

### Data Pipeline

> Was ist eine `Data-Pipeline`?

After streaming your data (in real time) // downloading your data from a provider, it's basically **a way to automate the process of data cleaning** in order to be able to get the plots // models from your "dirty data" in a fraction of the time you would spend, if you would do the data cleaning "by hand" yourself.

- <u>Youtube-Video</u>: [What is a Data-Pipeline?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzvF17ysbc)

### Fundamental-Daten
	
> Was versteht man unter `Fundamental-Daten`?

Fundamental-Daten sind **effektiv messbare Daten**, die über Datenbanken accessible sind und welche als Proxy - beispielsweise in Regressions-Analysen - verwendet werden können.

### Data-Flow

> Was versteht man unter dem `Data Flow`?

Mit dem `Data Flow` sollen folgende Fragen beantwortet werden:

1) Welche Daten werden wo geholt & wieso? 
2) Wie werden die Daten anschliessend verarbeitet?
3) Was ist der End-Output, nachdem die Daten - beispielsweise - in einem ML-Modell verwedet wurde?

Zur Illustration des `Data Flows`, gab es hierzu im Wissensaustausch auch eine Bild:

![Beispiel zum Data Flow](./bilder/beispiel-data-flow.jpg)

## Synonyme

### Data Science

- batch = sample-size when you train your model with a dataset
- Granularität (Beispiel) = Angenommen, man möchte wissen, wie viele Tage, Stunden, Minuten und Sekunden innerhalb von 20'044 Sekunden enthalten sind &#8594; hier haben wir also *Granularität von 4* &#8594; <u>Lösung</u>: 4 Tage, 18 Stunden, 37 Minuten, 44 Sekunden
- Kalibrierung des Modells == Wie wurde das Modell programmiert im Allgemeinen? &#8594; Dazu gehört - bei uns - die Anpassung der Prognose.
- label == true y-value
- `Pop` == "Pop" is simply a word that means "to drop something". For example, `df.pop('date')` means that I am dropping the column called "data" from a dataframe called "df". Fancily, if you write `df.pop('date')` and *save* it into another variable, then you can only **select** this dropped column from the ddset.
	- <u>Example</u>: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pop.html
- relativ zu == im Verhältnis zu
- shape == dimension
- target == predicted y-value
- Treiber == x-Variablen
- Volume == Speicherplatz
- weights == estimated coefficients

### Machine Learning

- `"feed in"` == plug in (--> häufig im Zusammenhang mit Einsetzen von konkreten Werten für die x-Variablen in das geschätzte Modell, um Predictions zu erhalten)
- `instance` == value within a cell == konkreter "x"-Wert, welcher angenommen wird und du - beispielsweise - für eine Prediction verwenden kannst.
- `Forcasted data` == These are the predictions that you do via the help of a model (--> by plugging in concrete x-values), that you've built.
- `Training Dataset` // `Training Set` == This is the sample, that you use to estimate your model.
- `Testing Dataset` // `Test Set` == This is the `hold out` set, which you use at the end, to check whether your model is able to `generalize` // `extrapolate` well to new data.
- `"the model is learning` == what is meant by "learning" is: given some Datenpunkt-Wolke, the computer will try and fit the "best line" [oftentimes by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals, if you use `OLS` (= Ordinary Least Squared)] to construct the "best model" possible.
- `Training` == You are estimating a model on the trainig-dataset, such that the model "learns" from the data.
- `shuffle` == englisches Wort für "mischen". In the context of `splitting the dataset into test- & training-data`, it is common practice to `shuffle` your observations within your dataset first.
	- <u>Reason why you `shuffle`</u>?: Shuffling data serves the purpose of
		- reducing variance AND 
		- making sure that models remain general AND 
		- overfit less.
	- <u>Merke</u>: When dealing with `time series`, you should not use `shuffle` when `splitting the data` into training- &amp; testing-data.
- `training score` // `Test Error` == This error // score is the [oftentimes squared] difference between the `true y-variable` and `estimated // predicted y-variable` and **measures // evaluates how well the model is "performing" // how good the model is on a `test set` with an increasingly bigger `training dataset`**.
- `cross-validation score` // `Validation Error` == This is the (mean) error // score [because of `cross-validation`] that **measures // evaluates how the model is "learning" over increasingly bigger `training datasets`**.
- `fold` == **subset** of the `training dataset`
	- <u>Example</u>: In a `K-Fold Cross-Validation`, you *randomly* split the <u>training set</u> into **10 distinct subsets**, which are called `folds`.
- `samples` == number of rows // number of observations within a dataset.
- `classifiers` == These are simply regression-functions, where the **Y-Variable is binary**, e.g. die Y-Variable kann nur `Y = 0` ODER `Y = 1` als Werte annehmen.
	- <u>Example</u>: Logit- &amp; Probit-Regression, or Naiv Bayes, etc...
- `initialization` // `declaration` // `specification` ==  This is the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable.
- `Array` == A List of Data is an array. It is a data structure, which contains "n" objects within a list.
	- <u>Quelle</u>: [The Coding Train 3:10-3:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NptnmWvkbTw&t=3m10s)
- `Extrapolation` == Voraussage von Y-Predict<u>ed</u> Values, welche mittels X-Variablen ermittelt werden, welche <u>zuvor nicht im Datensatz</u> waren.
- `Interpolation` == Voraussage von Y-Predict<u>ed</u> Values, welche mittels X-Variablen ermittelt werden, welche <u>bereits im Datensatz</u> waren, als die Schätzung  getätigt wurde.
- `sliding window` == This is just a way to tell python how to do a cross-validation and have equal lengths of time series where we can learn on.
- `Learning Task` == Forecasting Task // Extrapolation [in Time Series]
- `Forecasting Horizon` == Time Points, you want to predict (= dein ) $\hat{y}$
- `Time Heterogenous Data` == Different Time Series have different time stamps
	- <u>Quelle</u>: Ab 27:05 (Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf2naBHRo8Q&t=27m05s)
- `Seasonal Periodicity` == The number of months per year, in which the forecaster expects to see a seasonal pattern. 
	- <u>Concrete Example</u>: In Philipp's Notebook, he had a seasonal periodicity of 2, e.g. he said that in winter & sommer, he expects a seasonal pattern.
- `Reduction is composable` &#8594; Synonym wäre "addieren" &#8594; E.g. you can split a difficult task into a bunch of smaller tasks (= reduction) and "add" them together to solve the bigger task at the end (= "reduction is composable").
- `Pearson Korrelation` == <u>Lineare</u> Korrelation
- `Grid` &#8594; Das ist nichts anderes als die **Optimierung von diversen "Modell-Parametern"**. 
		- <u>Beispiel</u>: Bei Random-Forrest Modellen kann man zum Beispiel die Tiefe eines Modells bestimmen, dh die relevante Frage, welche ein Forscher sich stellt, ist, *wie viele Baum-Zweigungen die geeignesten Predictions bringen?* Mit Funktionen, wie zum Beispiel `GridSearchCV()` kann dieses Problem geregelt werden.
- `Classifier` == These are simply Regression-Functions, where **the Y-variable is binary**, e.g. die Y-Variable kann nur `Y = 0` <u>oder</u> `Y= = 1` als Werte annehmen. 
  - <u>Beispiele</u>: 
    - Logit-Regression
    - Probit-Regression
    - Naive Bayes
    - etc...


### Python

- `Module` == Python-File
- `PyPA` ==  Python Packaging Authority
- `PyPI` == Python Package Index

### IT &amp; Software-Development

- Abhängigkeitsprobleme == 1) Probleme bei den Versionen des Packages; 2) Packages werden vorausgesetzt, sodass gewisser Code dann einen Error printed, wenn man ihn nach 2 Jahren wiederverwenden will. 
- *agnostisch* == Im IT-Umfeld hat das Wort agnostisch eine besondere Bedeutung. Es bezieht sich auf etwas, das soweit **verallgemeinert** wird, dass es auch unter verschiedenen Umgebungen funktionieren kann. 
	- <u>Beispiel</u>: Eine Plattform-agnostische Software läuft unter jeder Kombination aus Betriebssystemen und Prozessorarchitekturen.
- *cached* == store away for future use
- *Client* == Damit ist häufig der Browser gemeint, wenn er Abfragen an den Server gibt.
- *composite* == custom
- *Remote* == Das ist z.B. ein Server / eine Maschine, die du nicht lokal bedienst.
- Rest API == Restful API
- *instanziieren* == Das Erzeugen eines Objekts in der objektorientierten Programmierung.

## Projekt-Management

- **Sitzungen müssen gut dokumentiert werden! Insbesondere ist hervorzuheben, in welche Richtung das Projekt geht.**

### Meetings

> Was ist das Ziel eines Meetings?

Das Ziel des Meetings ist es, dir & deinem Team die **nötige Basis zu geben, damit du in der folgenden Zeit bis zum nächsten Meeting genau weisst, was du zu tun hast**.

Am wichtigsten ist hier mit dem "Boss" zu reden und klar definieren, was er erreichen will im Projekt. Dies gibt die _globale Richtung_ des Projektes an.

_Es ist exterm wichtig, mit dem Boss diese Ziele zu definieren, da die Planung des gesamten Projektes in dieser Phase hier noch definiert werden kann. Nachdem diese anfängliche Gliederung getätigt wurde, kann im Verlauf des Projektes nicht mehr viel davon abgewichen werden. Deshalb hängt die Gesampt-Performance eines Projektes sehr stark von der anfänglichen Planung ab!_

<u>Während</u> des Projektes gibt es dann immer wieder folgende Punkte zu prüfen:

0) Sind die getätigten Schritte im Einklang mit dem Endziel des Bosses? Wichtig ist zu rechtfertigen, was du gerade am tun bist und warum genau du das tust.
1) Aufklärung, damit alle auf dem gleichen Informationsstand sind 
  - <u>Goal</u>: Wo stehen wir? Wie sieht die Situation mit dem Notebook aus?
2) Gibt es noch offene Lücken im Wissen eines Team-Mitglieds, welches von anderen Mitarbeitern gedeckt werden müsste? --> <u>Goal</u>: Kein Mitglied isolieren, jeder muss sich integriert fühlen. Insbesondere Wert auf Papers & Daten setzen hier
3) Was sind weitere offene Optionen und inwiefern eignen sich diese Ansätze für unser Ziel?
    - <u>Goal</u>: Aufzeigen, dass wir noch weitere Alternativen haben, als nur Phillip's Notebooks
4) Sonstige Unklarheiten / Bemerkungen / Inputs / Vorschläge? --> <u>Goal</u>: letzte Informationsasymmetrien beheben

> Was ist ein *Kanban*?

In der BWL-Sprache ist *Kanban* **ein Vorgehensmodell** zur Softwareentwicklung.
  
  - <u>Ziel #1</u>: Das Meetings soll die Anzahl an paralleler Arbeiten, (= **der Work in Progress (WiP)) minimiert // begrenzt werden** und somit kürzere Durchlaufzeiten erreicht.
  - <u>Ziel #2</u>: Das Meeting soll die Probleme – insbesondere **Engpässe – schnell sichtbar machen**.
