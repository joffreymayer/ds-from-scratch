For you to able to construct a book into an HTML-File, you will need the following 2 commands. The first is absolutely necessary, the second one is simply to check whether you rendered everything correctly by viewing the browser:

- `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` to render the `.md`-file into an `.html`-file.
- `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to see what happens.

In this bookdown-chapter, I will simply try to type some code, to see whether the code I have written truly works.
